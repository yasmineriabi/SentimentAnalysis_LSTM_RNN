# Sentiment Analysis with LSTM and RNN

This project compares two deep learning architectures (RNN and LSTM)
for binary sentiment classification using the IMDb dataset.

## Models
- **Simple RNN**: baseline sequential model
- **LSTM**: improved model capturing long-term dependencies
##  Results
| Model | Accuracy |
|--------|-----------|
| RNN | ~78% |
| LSTM | ~82% |

## Run the notebook
1. Clone this repo  
2. Open the notebook `sentiment_analysis_LSTM_RNN.ipynb`
3. Run all cells
